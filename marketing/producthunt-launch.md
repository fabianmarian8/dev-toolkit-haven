**Full Description:**

Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm excited to share **Free DevTools** - a collection of developer tools that are actually free (no hidden costs, no "freemium" nonsense).

## 😤 The Problem

Most "free" developer tools:
- Require email registration
- Have usage limits
- Track everything you do
- Suddenly introduce paywalls
- Upload your data to their servers

## ✅ The Solution

Free DevTools provides 12 essential utilities that are:

**100% Free Forever** - No hidden costs, no premium tiers, no limits

**Zero Registration** - Just open and use. No email, no account, nothing.

**Privacy-First** - All processing happens in YOUR browser. No data ever leaves your machine.

**Offline-Ready** - Works without internet after first load

## 🛠️ The Tools

1. **JSON Formatter** - Format, validate, and minify JSON data
2. **Base64 Encoder/Decoder** - Convert text and data to/from Base64
3. **Image Compressor** - Compress JPG, PNG, WebP without quality loss
4. **Color Picker** - Convert between HEX, RGB, HSL formats
5. **Regex Tester** - Test regular expressions with real-time matching
6. **Markdown Editor** - Write and preview markdown live
7. **Hash Generator** - Generate MD5, SHA-256, SHA-512 hashes
8. **QR Code Generator** - Create QR codes from text or URLs
9. **Text Diff Checker** - Compare text differences side-by-side
10. **URL Encoder/Decoder** - Encode and decode URLs properly
11. **UUID Generator** - Generate unique identifiers (v4)
12. **Timestamp Converter** - Convert Unix timestamps to dates

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

- No analytics on tool usage
- No data collection
- No cookies (except preferences)
- All processing client-side
- No server uploads
- Open to security audits

## 💻 Tech Stack

- React + TypeScript
- Vite for blazing-fast builds
- Tailwind CSS
- Client-side only processing
- Code splitting for performance

## 🎯 Who Is This For?

- **Developers** who value privacy
- **Students** learning to code
- **Teams** needing quick utilities
- **Anyone** tired of "freemium" tools

## 🚀 What's Next?

I'm planning to add:
- More tools based on feedback
- Dark/light theme customization
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Tool favorites/bookmarks
- PWA support for offline use

## 💬 I'd Love Your Feedback!
