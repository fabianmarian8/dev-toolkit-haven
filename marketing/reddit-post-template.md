Hey r/webdev! 👋

I've been frustrated with online dev tools that either require registration, have usage limits, or suddenly start charging. So I built **Free DevTools** - a collection of 12 essential developer tools that are:

✅ **100% Free Forever** - No hidden costs, no premium tiers  
✅ **No Registration** - Just open and use  
✅ **Privacy-First** - Everything runs in your browser  
✅ **No Limits** - Use as much as you want

**Tools included:**
- JSON Formatter & Validator
- Base64 Encoder/Decoder
- Image Compressor (JPG, PNG, WebP)
- Color Picker & Converter (HEX, RGB, HSL)
- Regex Tester with live matching
- Markdown Editor with preview
- Hash Generator (MD5, SHA-256, SHA-512)
- QR Code Generator
- Text Diff Checker
- URL Encoder/Decoder
- UUID Generator
- Timestamp Converter

All tools work offline after first load since everything processes client-side. No data ever leaves your browser.

Would love to hear your feedback or suggestions for new tools!
