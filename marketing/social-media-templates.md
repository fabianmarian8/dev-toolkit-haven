🚀 Introducing Free DevTools - A Developer's Toolkit

After years of dealing with "free" tools that require registration, have usage limits, or suddenly introduce paywalls, I decided to build something different.

Free DevTools is a collection of 12 essential developer utilities that are:

✅ 100% Free Forever - No hidden costs or premium tiers
✅ Zero Registration - No email, no account, just use it
✅ Privacy-First - All processing happens in your browser
✅ No Limits - Use as much as you want

Tools included:
• JSON Formatter & Validator
• Base64 Encoder/Decoder
• Image Compressor
• Color Picker & Converter
• Regex Tester
• Markdown Editor
• Hash Generator (MD5, SHA-256, SHA-512)
• QR Code Generator
• Text Diff Checker
• URL Encoder/Decoder
• UUID Generator
• Timestamp Converter

Built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. All tools work offline after the first load since everything processes client-side.

What tools do you use daily in your development workflow?

### Post 2: Privacy & Security Focus
```
🔒 Privacy in Developer Tools: Why It Matters

Many online developer tools upload your data to their servers for processing. This raises concerns:
• Sensitive API keys in JSON
• Proprietary code in diff checkers
• Client data in various formats

That's why I built Free DevTools with privacy as a core principle:

✓ All processing happens in YOUR browser
✓ No data ever leaves your machine
✓ No tracking or analytics on usage
✓ Works completely offline
